If tracking only counts and resolution=interval, handle an interval without data

Added optional compression on a series which will count unique hits on a

of the compression is up to the user in how they cast the data on insert.

Added optional prefix for time series keys

Fix problems with Timeseries.series() when count_only or step==resolution
